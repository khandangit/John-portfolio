  <h1>About John</h1>

  <div class="bio-box">
    <p>
      I am a self-taught artist with a passion for capturing people, animals, and everyday moments through drawing.
      My work blends careful observation with expressive mark-making, resulting in pieces that feel both personal and universal.
      Whether working in charcoal, pencil, or ink, I enjoy exploring light, texture, and emotion in my subjects.
